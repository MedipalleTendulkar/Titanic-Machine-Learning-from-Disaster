# Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster Survival Prediction using multiple classification models.

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions.

Thus, the goal of this competition is to predict if a passenger survived in the Titanic shipwreck or not. Binary classification problem based on a set of features describing such as his/her age, sex, or passengerId,class on the boat.

# Solution
In a form of a jupyter notebook, my solution goes through the basic steps of a data science pipeline:

Data Preprocessing-

Data cleaning,

Feature engineering.

Modelling.
